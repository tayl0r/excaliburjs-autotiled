# Project Guidelines

## After Completing Work

After finishing any feature, bugfix, or implementation task, update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the new status. Mark completed items as "Done" and add notes about what was implemented. This file tracks plan-vs-implementation status and must stay current.

When a new plan is added to `docs/plans/`, add a corresponding section to the CHANGELOG. The CHANGELOG references every spec and plan file in `docs/` — if those files are added, removed, or restructured, update the CHANGELOG to match.

## Git Workflow

Do not use git worktrees in this project. Work on the main branch or simple feature branches only.
