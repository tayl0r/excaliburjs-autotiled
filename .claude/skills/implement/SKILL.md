# Implement Plan

When the user provides a plan or design doc:
1. Read the plan fully once
2. Implement each step sequentially, making code changes immediately
3. Do NOT spend time researching or re-planning
4. After each step, run the full test suite
5. After each step, fix any failures or bugs, even if the problem is related to existing code or changes you did not make
6. After each step, launch an adversarial agent to review the code changes and resolve all issues
7. After each step, Commit with a descriptive message summarizing all changes
8. After all steps are completed, simplify the entire project codebase. Do not remove comments when simplifying.
